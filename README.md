## Pseudocode

When the user clicks a button, prompts appear in this order:
- Choose length (between & including 8 and 128 chars)
- Use square boxes to allow them to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters - at least one type must be selected
- Keep next button from being "clickable" til they select one choice

make sure there's a minimum of 1 from each array (incomplete)

insert into a new array all the complex rules that you need and randomize your final array

Then generate a password based on the criteria.

Finally, display the password on the page in the box.
